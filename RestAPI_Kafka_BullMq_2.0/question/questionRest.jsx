A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) 
is a way for applications to communicate with each other over the web using 
HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

“A REST API is a stateless web service that uses standard HTTP methods to 
perform CRUD operations on resources, usually exchanging data in JSON format.”

👉 In simple words:
It’s like a waiter in a restaurant.

You (client) ask for something using a request.

The waiter (API) brings it from the kitchen (server/database).

The response is delivered in a standard format (usually JSON).


Key Points:

REST is an architectural style, not a protocol.

REST APIs use standard HTTP methods:

GET → Fetch data

POST → Create new data

PUT/PATCH → Update existing data

DELETE → Remove data



Q what is cors?

👉 CORS is a way for a client from one domain to safely request and
 get information from a server on another domain.

So yes — it’s about allowing your frontend (client domain) 
to talk to your backend (server/database domain).

Do you want me to draw a small

1. Normal Request Flow (if allowed by CORS):

+------------------+                         +------------------+
|   Client (3000)  | ---- HTTP Request ----> |   Server (5000)  |
|   Browser/React  |                         |   Node/Express   |
+------------------+                         +------------------+
        |                                               |
        |   "Origin: http://localhost:3000"             |
        |---------------------------------------------->|
        |                                               |
        |   "Access-Control-Allow-Origin:               |
        |     http://localhost:3000"                    |
        |<----------------------------------------------|
        |                                               |
        |          ✅ Request Allowed                   |


        2. When Preflight (OPTIONS) Happens (for non-simple requests):

If the request uses:

PUT, DELETE, PATCH

Custom headers

Non-standard content types

The browser first sends an OPTIONS request.


Step 1: Browser → Server (Preflight Check)
----------------------------------------------------
OPTIONS /api/data HTTP/1.1
Origin: http://localhost:3000
Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type


Step 2: Server → Browser (CORS Response)
----------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type

✅ If allowed → Browser sends actual request next
❌ If not allowed → Browser blocks request


Q Key Difference:

express.json() → For API clients sending JSON (React, Angular, mobile apps, Postman).

express.urlencoded() → For HTML forms sending data in key=value format.



1. What is a Router?


⚡ How to remember for interview:

Router = Group of routes (mini app)

Route = One specific endpoint (URL + method)

REST = Using routes + HTTP methods for CRUD

A Router in Express is like a mini-application that handles a group of routes.

Instead of writing all routes inside app.js, we
 separate them into different files for clean code.

Think of it like:
👉 app = main highway
👉 router = smaller roads connected to it


🔹 2. What is a Route?
A Route defines how your app responds to different HTTP methods
 (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) at specific URLs.


Q: What is app.listen in Express.js?
A: app.listen starts the Express server
 and makes it listen
 for incoming requests on a specified port.


 Q what is Sehme ?

 ⚡ Interview One-Liner

A Schema is just the blueprint/structure for documents.

It defines fields, data types, and validation rules.

It does not talk directly to the database.


Model
A Model is created from a Schema.

It is the actual object we use to interact with the MongoDB collection.

With a Model, you can query, create, update, and delete documents


⚡ Interview One-Liner

Schema → Defines the structure of documents.

Model → Uses that schema to interact with the MongoDB collection.


🔹 What is a Collection in MongoDB?

A collection in MongoDB is a group of documents (like a table in SQL).

Each collection stores multiple documents (records).

Documents inside a collection don’t need to have the exact same fields, but they usually follow a common Schema when using Mongoose.



Q what is redis Cache?
A:
👉 Redis Cache is an in-memory key-value data store
 used to temporarily save frequently accessed data,
  so applications can retrieve it faster 
instead of querying the main database every time.

 Q: What is a MongoDB Query?

A MongoDB query is a way to request specific data from a MongoDB collection.
It tells the database what documents you want to find,
 update, or delete based on conditions.


 Example in simple words:

Think of a collection in MongoDB like a table of students:

[
  { "name": "Amit", "age": 22, "city": "Delhi" },
  { "name": "Sara", "age": 25, "city": "Mumbai" },
  { "name": "John", "age": 22, "city": "Delhi" }
]

Q::Kafka (1-line interview answer):
“Apache Kafka is a high-throughput, distributed 
messaging system used to publish and subscribe to streams
 of records in real-time.”]


 How it works step by step:

Client posts data to your API.

API sends data to Kafka Producer → Kafka stores it in a topic.

Kafka Consumer (running in background) listens to the topic.

Consumer receives the data and saves it to MongoDB.

Client can fetch saved data using a GET API anytime.


✅ Benefit: Your client doesn’t have to wait for MongoDB write → faster response.
✅ Kafka ensures no data loss, even if MongoDB is slow.


Your scenario (rephrased):

Client posts data to your server/API.

Normally, the server writes the data to MongoDB.

If MongoDB fails (data not saved), you still want the client to get a response.

You are using Kafka:

The producer sends the data to Kafka immediately.

The consumer takes data from Kafka and writes it to MongoDB asynchronously.

Sometimes the data might be “broken” or incomplete when the producer sends it.


Q what is middleware?




Q RateLimit ?

Rate limiting is a technique used to control how many requests a client 
can make to your API in a given time period.

Simple Explanation

Prevents abuse or overload of your server.

Example: “A user can only make 100 requests per minute.”

If a user exceeds this limit, the API responds with 429 Too Many Requests.



Q what is JWT ?

So yes, it’s unique and secure, but it’s more than just a hash — it’s a signed token containing user info.

Step 1: User Logs In

Client sends login credentials (email/password) to your API.

Server verifies the credentials in the database (MongoDB).

✅ Advantages

Stateless → server doesn’t need to store sessions.

Secure → signed token ensures integrity.

Portable → can be used across multiple services.

Flexible → you can store roles, permissions, or any claims.

tep 4: Client Sends JWT with Requests

Every time the client wants to access a protected route, it sends the JWT in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>


Q what is credentials?
💡 Simple rule:

Credentials
 → Authenticated Token/Cookie →
  Access backend safely.



  Q what authentication and Authorization?



  Authentication

Means verifying the user’s identity.

It usually involves sending user details (like email/password) to the server via a POST request.

Server checks if the credentials are correct.

If valid → user is authenticated.

Example:

Client POSTs login details → server verifies → authentication successful → server issues JWT.

Authorization

Means checking what the authenticated user is allowed to do.

JWT can help with this: server reads the claims/roles inside the token to decide access.

Only then the server shows user details or allows certain actions.

Example:

JWT contains role: admin → server allows deleting a user.

JWT contains role: user → server allows only reading own data.
