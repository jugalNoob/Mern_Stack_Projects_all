              üí° Tip for checking all files in all subfolders (recursive) on Windows Command Prompt:

dir /s -->check file Important 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Cluster (Node.js Cluster)

Node.js runs on a single thread by default.

Cluster module allows you to create multiple worker processes to use all CPU cores.

This improves performance for handling many simultaneous requests.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Kafka

Kafka is a high-throughput message broker.

It allows producers to send messages and consumers to process them asynchronously.

Useful for decoupling services and handling event-driven architectures.

Example: client posts data ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí consumer ‚Üí MongoDB.

3Ô∏è‚É£ BullMQ

BullMQ is a queue library for Node.js, often backed by Redis.

Used for background job processing.

Example: Sending data from Kafka to MongoDB asynchronously, retrying if it fails.

4Ô∏è‚É£ MongoDB Queries

MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-based database.

You interact with it using queries: find, insert, update, delete.

Example:

find() ‚Üí get data

insertOne() ‚Üí insert a document

updateOne() ‚Üí update document

5Ô∏è‚É£ Redis Cache

Redis is an in-memory key-value store.

Used to cache frequent queries so your API is faster and reduces load on MongoDB.

Example: cache the last 10k posts so new users don‚Äôt hit MongoDB every time.

6Ô∏è‚É£ REST API

REST API = way to communicate over HTTP.

Exposes endpoints like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for your data.

Example: /posts ‚Üí get all posts, /post ‚Üí create a post.

7Ô∏è‚É£ CORS

CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

Controls which websites can make requests to your API.

Necessary if your frontend (React/Angular) runs on a different domain than your backend.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Docker

Docker is a containerization tool.

Packages your API, database, Redis, etc., into isolated containers.

Makes your app portable, easy to deploy, and consistent across environments.



Q RateLimit ?

Rate limiting is a technique used to control how many requests a client can make to your API in a given time period.

Simple Explanation

Prevents abuse or overload of your server.

Example: ‚ÄúA user can only make 100 requests per minute.‚Äù

If a user exceeds this limit, the API responds with 429 Too Many Requests.

My Opinion on Your Stack

‚úÖ Very strong and modern stack

‚úÖ Handles high throughput (Cluster + Kafka + BullMQ)

‚úÖ Scalable reads/writes (MongoDB + Redis)

‚úÖ Portable deployment (Docker)

‚úÖ Secure and structured API (REST + CORS)

Advice:

Make sure you handle data validation before sending to Kafka/queues.

Use Redis caching wisely to reduce DB load.

Monitor performance of MongoDB under high load.
