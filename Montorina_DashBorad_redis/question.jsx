Nice ðŸ‘Œ If you present this project in an interview, the interviewer might test both your practical code knowledge and your system design reasoning.
Here are some realistic interview questions you could be asked:

ðŸ”¥ Interview Questions for Your Project
ðŸ“Œ Basics

Can you explain how data flows from your system metrics collector to the frontend dashboard?

Why did you choose Socket.IO instead of plain WebSockets or SSE (Server-Sent Events)?

Whatâ€™s the difference between using Socket.IO directly vs using Redis Pub/Sub in between?

ðŸ“Œ Redis Pub/Sub

Why did you add Redis to your architecture when you could send metrics directly through Socket.IO?

What happens if one of your Node.js servers crashes? How does Redis help in recovery?

Can you explain how the Socket.IO Redis adapter works when scaling across multiple servers?

Whatâ€™s the difference between Redis Pub/Sub and Redis Streams, and when would you use Streams here?

ðŸ“Œ Performance & Scaling

How would your system behave if you had 100k clients connected at once?

What bottlenecks do you expect in your architecture, and how would you solve them?

If your publisher sends metrics every 1 second, how do you avoid overwhelming clients or Redis?

How would you partition metrics if you had multiple data sources (CPU, network, Kafka, MongoDB stats)?

ðŸ“Œ Reliability & Security

What happens if Redis goes down? Can your system still function?

How would you secure your Socket.IO connections?

How do you make sure that only authorized clients can see the system metrics?

How would you handle message loss or retries in Redis Pub/Sub?

ðŸ“Œ Advanced / System Design

How would you extend your system to handle metrics from multiple servers (not just local machine)?

How would you add alerts (e.g., CPU > 80%) to your real-time dashboard?

If you needed historical data (not just real-time), how would you store and query it?

How would you compare this architecture with using Kafka instead of Redis?

How would you deploy this system in production (Docker, Kubernetes, scaling strategy)?

ðŸ‘‰ These questions test:

Your code understanding (Socket.IO, Redis usage)

Your design trade-offs (why Redis, why not direct Socket.IO)

Your scalability mindset (handling 100k clients, multiple servers)

Do you want me to also write model answers for the top 5 tricky questions (like why Redis, Redis Pub/Sub vs Streams, scaling Socket.IO, etc.) so you can practice?
