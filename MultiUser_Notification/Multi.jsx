Perfect ðŸš€ â€” Iâ€™ll polish your diagram into a professional, high-level architecture that looks clean, structured, and resume/project-doc ready.

Hereâ€™s the plan for the design upgrade:

ðŸ”¹ Polished High-Level Architecture

Client / API Layer

User hits API â†’ goes to Router (Express/Node.js).

Event Routing

Router directs to specific events (Good Morning, Good Night, etc.).

Kafka Layer

Each event goes to a Kafka Producer â†’ pushes messages into Kafka topics.

Topics are partitioned â†’ scalable across consumers.

Consumer Layer

Kafka Consumers subscribe to their respective topics.

Queue & Retry Layer (BullMQ)

Each Consumer sends jobs to BullMQ for retries, scheduling, or background execution.

Output / Action Layer

Final delivery: Socket.IO (real-time updates) / Email / Push Notification / DB writes.



ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to estimate the exact number of notifications per 
second your design can handle (with example config: partitions =
    3, consumers = 6, Redis concurrency = 100)?


    5. Notification Delivery

If youâ€™re using:

Socket.IO (WebSockets) â†’ Can handle 10kâ€“100k concurrent connections per Node.js server, scale with Redis adapter across servers â†’ millions of live users.

Email / Push Notifications â†’ Depends on external service provider (SES, Firebase, Twilio, etc.).
